I am currently working on developing a cross-platform application for the healthcare sector.
I am exploring ideas on how to make a health care system that provides ease to people and trying my best to use technology to provide facilities where there is a shortage of doctors' facilities; scheduling doctors; taking appointments; and real-time availability over GMap and booking it.

This will have 2 apps overall.
1.To provide users with basic services
2. For doctors who receive appointments, they should schedule them with patients. Whenever the meeting is over, the doctor has to upload all the details. What is the cause? and displaying this data to patients as well, so that patients can monitor their diseases and have a more comprehensive healthcare system.

I will be using Firebase as a backend and Flutter as a frontend. I will be using Agora SDK for video calling and will also integrate a chat feature/AI bot for instant messaging and integration of ML for recommendation purposes also.
